# SpaceMouse

This is an alternate software to run on the Space Mouse With Arduino Micro as described here:
https://www.instructables.com/Space-Mouse-With-Arduino-Micro-Fully-Printable/ by Stefano Sbarra.

In this Instructable project, Stefano's original software was mainly targeting Inventor and partially Fusion 360 if set in Inventor mode.
Beside this I also wanted some more features compared to what Stefano was proposing, hence I started to modify its original source code to fully fit with Fusion 360 and my personal needs.

Enjoy and feel free to mofify this software to suit *your* needs !
